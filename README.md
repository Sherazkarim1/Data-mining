## Project Overview

This project is focused on **Data Mining** techniques to analyze, process, and extract meaningful insights from large datasets. The aim is to apply various data mining algorithms and methods to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of popular data mining algorithms such as:
  - Decision Trees
  - Association Rule Mining (e.g., Apriori)
  - Clustering (e.g., K-Means)
  - Classification (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes)
- Visualization of data and results
- Performance evaluation of models
